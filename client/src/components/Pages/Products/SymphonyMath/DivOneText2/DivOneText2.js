        Many students struggle with math because they rely on arbitrary
        memorization techniques to answer specific questions. With this
        approach, students do not gain a substantive understanding of
        fundamentals and simply cannot adjust to more sophisticated problem
        solving. With Symphony Math®, these problems are resolved. A web-enabled
        program with a visual and highly intuitive interface, Symphony Math®
        helps students understand at a conceptual level. Instead of being
        overwhelmed by numbers, students move at their own speed and learn how
        math works. Through every stage of Symphony Math®, students gain a
        strong foundation in underlying principles and become better equipped to
        take on basic and advanced subjects. Going far beyond rote math drills
        and practice tests, this special teaching solution illuminates the core
        of learning and produces confident, more capable students.
