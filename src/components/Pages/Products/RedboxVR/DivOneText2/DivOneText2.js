        The RedboxVR ‘student devices’ are set up to run Google Expeditions,
        although they are compatible with other VR (virtual reality) or AR
        (augmented reality) Play Store apps. In addition to Google Expeditions,
        all our kits come pre-loaded with the excellent MEL Chemistry software.
        This gives you an exclusive 12 month Free Subscription to the MEL
        Chemistry package. Another great app, for example is Anatomy4D which
        allows you to see inside the anatomy by using the devices as AR viewers.
        Another great use of the system is to use a 360 camera such as the Ricoh
        Theta V to create your own stunning 360 videos of whatever you want and
        share them with your class using our VR kit. We can include a Ricoh
        Theta V camera with your kit, if required, to get you creating content
        straight away! Also, Vimeo360 and YouTube360 are an excellence resource
        for existing online 360 content, again perfectly compatible with our
        kits. A full introduction to RedboxVR is available HERE To see our
        latest brochure please click HERE All kits are covered with a 2 year
        protection plan which includes telephone and online support. The
        ‘student devices’ are fully configured to a Gmail or G-Suite account, so
        it’s ready to go straight out of the box. A video of our kits being
        produced is available HERE. Here's the Technical Specification in PDF.
