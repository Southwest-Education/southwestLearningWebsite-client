        The Reading Plus adaptive assessment, InSight, is a valid and reliable
        assessment that was created under the direction and guidance of leading
        reading and assessment researchers. InSight goes beyond typical measures
        of comprehension and vocabulary by also measuring comprehension-based
        silent reading rate and motivation. The rich data not only gives
        teachers a deep understanding of their students' needs, but also
        empowers students to follow their own personalized paths to reading
        proficiency.
