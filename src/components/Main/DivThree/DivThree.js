        Great teaching has always been the secret to opening the eyes and minds
        of students, but with the introduction of Google Expeditions, we really
        are looking at a game changer when it comes to learning. Imagine being
        able to transport students to some of the most fascinating and inspiring
        destinations without ever leaving the classroom.
